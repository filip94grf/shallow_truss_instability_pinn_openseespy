Shallow-Truss-Instability-PINN

This repository contains Physics-Informed Neural Network models for prediction of Von Mises shallow truss instability, using three algorithms including:
1. Adaptive moment estimation (Adam)
2. Nesterov-accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam)
3. EvoLved Sign Momentum (Lion)

!!!Files contained Python scripts for complete reproduction of the developed PINN models!!!

!!!Before you run the analysis you must specify the geometrical and material properties, as well as spring stiffness: E1, E2, A1, A2, Lleft, Lright, h, Ks!!!

!!!To make completely the same results results are freezed using random.seed(seed_value), for each slope, material and geometrical properties!!!
